  <p>
    The HyperText Markup Language or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"
    target="_blank" title="wikipedia_HTML">HTML</a> is the standard markup language for documents
    designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies
    such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

  <p>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
    of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
  <p>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
    With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms
    may be embedded into the rendered page.
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
    for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>
